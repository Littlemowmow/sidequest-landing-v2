      q: "Why SideQuest? What makes it different?",
      a: "Most travel apps focus on booking flights and hotels. SideQuest focuses on the part nobody else solves — the messy group coordination that happens before you book anything. Budget debates, destination voting, splitting costs fairly. We turn chaotic group chats into an organized trip plan everyone agrees on. And unlike a booking app, we don't care where you book — we just make sure your group actually agrees before you do."
    },
    {
      q: "What if my friends always flake?",
      a: "That's literally why we built this. SideQuest has voting deadlines, budget locks, and shared itineraries that make it harder for anyone to quietly back out. When everyone can see who's voted, who's committed, and what it costs — the 'let me check with work' excuse loses its power. We can't fix your flaky friend, but we can make it really obvious when they're flaking."
    },
    {
      q: "Why not just use a spreadsheet or group chat?",
      a: "Because spreadsheets don't handle disagreements, and group chats bury decisions under 200 unread messages. SideQuest gives your group a structured way to vote on destinations, set budgets together, and track who owes what — without anyone having to play \"trip coordinator.\" Plus, be honest — when's the last time everyone actually opened the Google Doc?"
    },
    {
      q: "Is there AI involved?",
      a: "Yes, but not in a gimmicky way. SideQuest uses AI to surface hidden gems and local recommendations you won't find on the first page of Google. Think of it as a local friend who knows every city — not a chatbot that plans your trip for you."
    },
    {
      q: "Does everyone in the group need the app?",
      a: "Ideally, yes — so everyone can vote and contribute to the plan. But you can share a read-only view of the itinerary with anyone, so even friends who haven't downloaded it can stay in the loop."
    },
    {
      q: "Is SideQuest free?",
      a: "The beta is free. After that, we're planning a low monthly price — think less than one overpriced tourist trap coffee. Early waitlist members will lock in the lowest price permanently."
    },
    {
      q: "Who's building SideQuest?",
      a: "We're college students at the University of Michigan who got tired of watching amazing trip ideas die in our group chats. We built SideQuest because we needed it ourselves."
    },
    {
      q: "When is the beta launching?",
      a: "Very soon — we're opening spots in waves. Claim your spot now to secure your place in the first wave and help shape what SideQuest becomes."
    },
    {
      q: "Why not just go solo?",
      a: "Solo travel is amazing — seriously. But if you've got a group of friends you actually want to travel with, the problem isn't the people. It's that group chats are terrible planning tools. SideQuest doesn't replace solo travel — it makes group travel actually possible so you don't have to choose."
